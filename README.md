## Steps to run the app locally
> Assuming you already have Git and NPM installed on your system and know how to use command prompt/terminal.
* Open command prompt (or terminal) and change the current working directory to location where you want to clone the repository.
* Then type: *git clone https://github.com/OptimalLearner/Fusion.git*
* If the clone was successfully completed then a new sub directory may appear with the same name as the repository.
* Now change the currently directory to the new sub directory.
* Install http server using this command: *npm install --global http-server* (This step can be skipped if you already have http-server installed)
* Then simply return to main directory and run the http-server using this command: *http-server -p 5500*
* Now you can access the app on http://localhost:5500/
